# Nandoku

## A React web app side project. The MVP is a mulitple choice Japanese reading game.
Playable in a smartphone or PC browser. The game tests the player on their reading knowledge of difficult Japanese kanji characters.
The characters are difficult for native speakers, not found in the 'regularly used' characters list (常用漢字).



# How To Play
### visit https://nandoku.netlify.app/ 
(or clone the repo, install the dependencies with npm i and run in the browser with npm start)

### Choose a category from the menu page.

### set a number of rounds from the drop down list (10, 20 or 50)

### click start '開始' to begin the game.

### Look at the kanji, then try to choose the correct hiragana reading from the multiple choice options.

### Click the option you think is correct and see the result. 
Click 次 to move to the next question. View your score throughout at the top of the page.

### Your percentage score is shown on Game Over (when the number of set rounds is complete)

### Return to the menu page at any time using the back arrow in the upper left.



#### More about the game and process 
I had the idea to build this game for a long time as I saved a list of the characters in my phone dictionary to test friends.
However, the dictionary list is not sorted into categories, there are no answer choices, a score cannot be shown. 
It is more of an unorganised flashcard activity than a kanji reading game.

I used React.js with chakra UI to bring in neat, customisable components. It is the first full application I attempted solo since completing the School of Code bootcamp.
When facing errors, I sought help from fellow bootcampers :) shoutout to them!
